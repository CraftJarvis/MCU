**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task**
 - whether the agent lays out the initial boundary of the maze
 - whether the agent creates a series of pathways and dead ends
 - whether the agent ensures there is a start and finish point in the maze

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. excessive wandering without building, placing blocks randomly without a clear pattern

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes incorrectly placed walls or pathways that do not connect or make sense
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. incorporating unique patterns or themes into the maze design, using different levels or heights to add complexity

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent chooses appropriate materials to distinguish pathways from walls
 - whether the agent uses materials that enhance the maze's functionality or aesthetic appeal

**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent identifies and approaches the location of iron ore
 - whether the agent uses a suitable tool to mine the iron ore
 - whether the agent successfully collects the mined iron ore

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. mining or interacting with blocks that are not relevant to obtaining iron ore
 - wandering aimlessly without focusing on the task

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes the use of an inappropriate tool and switches to a suitable one
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. finding innovative paths or strategies to reach the iron ore
 - using different strategies to handle environmental challenges, like lava or water

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses the correct type of pickaxe for mining iron ore
 - whether the agent conserves tool durability by avoiding unnecessary use

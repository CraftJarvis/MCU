**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent locates and approaches a boat
 - whether the agent enters the boat
 - whether the agent navigates the boat on water
 - whether the agent explores specific areas or landmarks while in the boat

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly without a clear exploration path
 - e.g. unnecessarily entering and exiting the boat multiple times

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when the boat is stuck or not moving and takes corrective actions
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. exploring unique or challenging waterways or taking scenic routes
 - e.g. using the boat for unexpected purposes like reaching hard-to-access areas

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the exploration falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective navigation strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent effectively uses the boat and any other materials necessary for navigation and exploration tasks.

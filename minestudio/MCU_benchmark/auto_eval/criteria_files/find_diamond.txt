**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
- whether the agent mines deep enough underground where diamonds typically spawn (below Y-level 16)
- whether the agent locates and mines diamond ore
- whether the agent collects the diamond item

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
- e.g. mining irrelevant blocks or resources excessively
- e.g. wandering aimlessly without a clear strategy for finding diamonds

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
- e.g. whether agents recognize incorrect mining levels or unproductive mining areas and adjust their strategy
- whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
- e.g. using different mining techniques like strip mining, branch mining, or cave exploration
- e.g. utilizing tools or strategies to improve efficiency, such as using enchanted pickaxes or bringing torches for visibility

**Task Completion Efficiency**
- whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
- whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
- whether the agent uses the appropriate tools (e.g., iron pickaxe or better) for mining diamond ore
- whether the agent manages resources effectively, such as conserving tool durability or using appropriate mining techniques

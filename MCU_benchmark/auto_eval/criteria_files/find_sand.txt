**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent navigates towards areas where sand is likely to be found, such as beaches or deserts
 - whether the agent identifies sand blocks visually or through interaction
 - whether the agent collects or interacts with the sand blocks

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly without focusing on finding sand, getting distracted by unrelated items or blocks
 - e.g. engaging in unnecessary mining of non-sand blocks

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when it is in a non-sand area and redirects to a more promising location
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement in locating sand

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using tools like shovels to quickly collect sand, or employing strategies to locate sand more efficiently
 - e.g. attempting to find sand in less conventional locations, such as underwater or near riverbanks

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to locate and interact with sand falls within a reasonable range
 - whether navigation strategies were employed effectively to minimize unnecessary movements or detours

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. whether the agent uses appropriate tools, like shovels, for collecting sand efficiently

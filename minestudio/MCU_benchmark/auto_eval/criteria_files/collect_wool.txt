**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent finds and interacts with a sheep
 - whether the agent uses dye on the sheep
 - whether the agent shears the dyed sheep to obtain wool

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. attacking the sheep instead of dyeing it, unnecessary movement around the environment, or interacting with other animals.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if it uses the wrong dye or shears a sheep without dyeing it first, and proceeds to correct the mistake.
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using multiple dyes to create different colors of wool.
 - e.g. implementing efficient methods to handle multiple sheep for faster wool collection.

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors in finding, dyeing, and shearing the sheep.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses the appropriate dye and shears in the correct sequence to achieve the task.

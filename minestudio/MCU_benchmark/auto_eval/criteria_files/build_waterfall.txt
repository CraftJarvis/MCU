**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent identifies an appropriate location for the waterfall
 - whether the agent constructs a structure to guide the water flow
 - whether the agent successfully places the water source block to create the waterfall

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. destroy or place irrelevant blocks not part of the waterfall structure
 - e.g. excessive movements or actions that do not contribute to the waterfall construction

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if the water flow is not correct or if the structure is misaligned
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. adding decorative elements like rocks, plants, or lighting around the waterfall
 - e.g. varying the height or width of the waterfall to create a more visually appealing design

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate materials for the waterfall structure (e.g., stone, dirt, etc.)
 - whether the agent efficiently uses the water source blocks to create a continuous flow

**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent locates and enters a mine or digs underground to create one
 - whether the agent mines horizontally, creating a tunnel
 - whether the agent retrieves any valuable resources such as coal, iron, or other ores

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. digging vertically or in random directions not aligned with the horizontal mining task
 - e.g. placing blocks unnecessarily or engaging in combat unrelated to the task

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when it has deviated from horizontal mining and corrects its path
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product, such as avoiding dead ends or unnecessary turns in the tunnel

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. creating organized and well-lit tunnels for efficient navigation and resource collection
 - e.g. setting up landmarks or markers to avoid getting lost

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to maximize the retrieval of resources and minimize unnecessary digging

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools (e.g., pickaxes) for mining
 - whether the agent manages resources like torches for lighting the mine effectively

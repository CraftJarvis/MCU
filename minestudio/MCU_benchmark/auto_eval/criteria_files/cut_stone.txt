**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task**  
 - whether the agent places the stonecutter in the desired location  
 - whether the agent interacts with the stonecutter  
 - whether the agent selects the stone from the inventory to cut  
 - whether the agent successfully cuts the stone using the stonecutter  

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**  
 - e.g. wandering away from the stonecutter after placement  
 - e.g. attempting to interact with unrelated blocks or items  

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**  
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if the stonecutter is not placed correctly or not functioning  
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement, such as properly selecting the stone to cut  

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**  
 - e.g. try to use different types of stones to see what can be cut  
 - e.g. arrange the cut stones in a unique pattern or structure  

**Task Completion Efficiency**  
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range  
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary actions or errors  

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**  
 - e.g. whether the agent uses the correct type of stone for cutting  
 - whether the agent ensures the stonecutter is used appropriately with the right materials

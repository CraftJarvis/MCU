**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent interacts with the shield
 - whether the agent equips the shield in the off-hand slot
 - whether the agent successfully uses the shield to block an attack

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. swinging other items or weapons unnecessarily while holding the shield

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes incorrect positioning or timing while using the shield
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using the shield in combination with other tactics or maneuvers to enhance defense
 - e.g. experimenting with different timings to optimize blocking effectiveness

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary actions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent correctly equips and uses the shield as intended without damaging or misplacing it.

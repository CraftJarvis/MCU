**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent interacts with the dirt block
 - whether the agent successfully mines a dirt block

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly, mining blocks other than dirt, or performing unrelated actions like placing blocks

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when it has mined the wrong block and correctly targets dirt blocks afterward
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different tools to mine the dirt, like hands or a shovel
 - e.g. mining dirt in a pattern or specific shape

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools for mining dirt, such as shovels for faster mining

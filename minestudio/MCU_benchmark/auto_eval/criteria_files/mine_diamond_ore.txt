**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent identifies and locates diamond ore
 - whether the agent successfully mines the diamond ore
 - whether the agent collects the mined diamond

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. aimlessly mining other blocks not related to the task, wandering without purpose in unrelated areas

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent corrects its path if it's mining in the wrong direction
 - whether the agent adjusts its mining technique if it initially fails to mine the diamond ore efficiently

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using strategic mining patterns such as branch mining or strip mining to locate diamond ore
 - e.g. utilizing torches or other light sources to improve visibility in dark areas

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary mining or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses the appropriate tools for mining diamond ore, such as an iron pickaxe or better

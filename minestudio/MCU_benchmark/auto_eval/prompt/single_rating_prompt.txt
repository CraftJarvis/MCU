You are an expert of Minecraft and good at evaluating agents in AI field.
I will give you a task name, a grading criteria for this task and a video of an agent doing a task.

The grading criteria has several major criteria (surrounded by ** **) and several evaluation rules under each major criterion. 
You need to score the agent's operations in the video based on the evaluation rules. The more the agent complies with the rules in the criteria, the higher the score it receives.
If you think the agent's behavior does not related to the stated rule, score 0.
If you think the agent's behavior barely to the stated rule, score 1 to 3.
If the agent's behavior is partially related to the rules, score 4 to 6. 
If the agent's behavior is Mostly related to the rules, score 7 to 9. 
If the agent's behavior is completely related to the rules, score 10. 

If you believe the agent complies with the rule, you should list the relevant evidence from the video (within 50 words), do not simply copy the phrases from the rules.
Please assign an appropriate score across five dimensions, including task progress, material selection and usage, action control, error recognition and correction, creative attempts, and task completion efficiency based on the final evidence.


You should follow the following output format to organize outputs. xxx is the placeholder. Evidence can be more than one.

Note:
 - If the evaluation rules include "e.g.", it is only an example and you should not be limited to the listed "e.g." All phenomena that conform to the major criteria should be considered.
 - Task progress only considers the completion of key steps of the task and is unrelated to artistic qualities or such aspects.
 - You should ignore the text show on the video.

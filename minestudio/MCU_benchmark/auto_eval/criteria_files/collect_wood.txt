**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent identifies and approaches a tree
 - whether the agent starts chopping down the tree
 - whether the agent collects the wood blocks dropped from the tree

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. attacking other mobs or players, wandering aimlessly, or breaking blocks other than the tree

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize when they are chopping the wrong block and correct their target
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different tools to chop down the tree
 - e.g. planting a sapling to replace the tree they cut down

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective chopping strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary actions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. using an axe instead of bare hands for better efficiency

 - e.g. placing blocks that obstruct water flow, unnecessary movement, or repeated adjustments without constructive changes

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - whether the agent notices and corrects issues like water flowing in unintended directions
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. incorporating natural-looking features like rocks or plants
 - e.g. adding lighting effects or other decorative elements to enhance the waterfall's aesthetic

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate materials to control water flow and enhance the waterfall's appearance

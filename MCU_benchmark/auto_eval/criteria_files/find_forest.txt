**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task**
 - whether the agent correctly identifies the biome as a forest
 - whether the agent navigates towards the forest biome
 - whether the agent successfully reaches the forest biome

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. aimless wandering in non-forest biomes, unnecessary interactions with unrelated blocks or entities.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent can recognize when it is not in a forest biome and adjust its path accordingly.
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement in navigation accuracy and efficiency.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. the agent uses landmarks or environmental cues creatively to locate the forest.
 - e.g. the agent employs a novel pathfinding strategy to reach the forest quickly.

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether the agent uses efficient navigation techniques to minimize unnecessary detours or delays.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - Evaluating if the agent uses any tools or materials effectively to aid in the navigation process (e.g., using a map or compass if available).

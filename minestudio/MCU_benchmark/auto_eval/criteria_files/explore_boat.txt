 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective navigation strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses the boat correctly and does not waste materials

**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent gather the necessary materials (snow blocks and a pumpkin)
 - whether the agent stack two snow blocks on top of each other
 - whether the agent place a pumpkin on top of the snow blocks to create the snow golem

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. gathering unnecessary materials, placing blocks unrelated to the golem construction, or wandering aimlessly without making progress.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes incorrect placement of blocks or wrong materials and adjusts accordingly.
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. decorate the area around the snow golem, use different block arrangements for aesthetic purposes.

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. whether the agent correctly obtains and uses snow blocks and a pumpkin to build the snow golem.

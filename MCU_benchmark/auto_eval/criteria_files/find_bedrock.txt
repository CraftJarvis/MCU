**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent is actively mining or exploring to find bedrock
 - whether the agent reaches the lowest levels of the world (Y-level 0 to -64)
 - whether the agent successfully identifies bedrock

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. mining unnecessary blocks that do not contribute to reaching bedrock
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly without a clear downward path

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when it is not at the correct depth and adjusts its mining strategy
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different mining strategies or paths to reach bedrock
 - e.g. creating safe pathways to avoid hazards like lava or falling

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools for mining
 - whether the agent conserves resources and manages inventory effectively while searching for bedrock

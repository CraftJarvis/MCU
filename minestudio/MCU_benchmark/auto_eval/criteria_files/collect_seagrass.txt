**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task**
 - whether the agent dives into the water
 - whether the agent locates seagrass
 - whether the agent collects seagrass

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. swimming aimlessly without targeting seagrass, collecting unrelated items or blocks.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when it collects the wrong items and corrects this behavior
 - whether the agent adjusts its approach if it initially fails to collect seagrass

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. employing different methods to collect the seagrass, such as using shears or hands
 - e.g. exploring different underwater biomes to find seagrass

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary actions and maximize collection speed

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. using appropriate tools like shears to collect seagrass efficiently
 - e.g. managing inventory space to ensure enough room for seagrass collection

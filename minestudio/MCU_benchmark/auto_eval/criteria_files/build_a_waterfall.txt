**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent selects an appropriate location for building the waterfall
 - whether the agent builds a structure (e.g., a cliff or a platform) to create the waterfall from
 - whether the agent correctly places the water source block at the top of the structure
 - whether the water flows down to create the waterfall effect

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. unnecessary digging or building in unrelated areas
 - e.g. placing and removing blocks repeatedly without purpose

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize if the water is not flowing correctly and adjust the structure or placement
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. adding decorative elements like rocks, plants, or lighting around the waterfall
 - e.g. creating multiple tiers or layers in the waterfall for a more complex design

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate materials to build the structure supporting the waterfall
 - whether the agent effectively manages the water source blocks to create the desired waterfall effect

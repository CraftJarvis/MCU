**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent starts climbing the mountain
 - whether the agent reaches the top of the mountain
 - whether the agent navigates obstacles effectively

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly without making progress in climbing, destroying blocks without necessity, or repeatedly falling off the mountain.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize inefficient climbing routes and adjust their path
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different tools or strategies to climb, building temporary structures to aid in climbing, or finding shortcuts.

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective climbing strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools and materials (e.g., ladders, blocks) to assist in climbing.
 - whether the agent conserves resources effectively.

text: combat and fend off wolves
thinking: '- In order to combat wolves, we need weapons, armor, and wolves nearby.
  Firstly, the Iron Armor Set provides good protection. Secondly, a Bow with Arrows
  allows for ranged attacks, which can be useful against aggressive wolves. Wolves
  usually turn hostile when attacked, so being prepared for multiple encounters is
  wise.'

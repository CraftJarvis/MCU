**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent successfully navigates the environment to search for lava
 - whether the agent identifies visual or environmental cues that indicate the presence of lava, such as light or specific terrain
 - whether the agent confirms the presence of lava by visually inspecting or interacting with it

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly without a clear strategy or path 
 - engaging in unrelated actions like mining or crafting without purpose

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent corrects its path if it enters a dead end or wrong area
 - whether the agent adjusts its search strategy if no lava is found initially

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using unique navigation methods such as building temporary structures to gain a vantage point
 - implementing innovative search patterns or using tools to enhance lava detection

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to find the lava falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective exploration strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary movements or backtracking

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools or materials to aid in the search for lava, such as torches for lighting or blocks for building paths

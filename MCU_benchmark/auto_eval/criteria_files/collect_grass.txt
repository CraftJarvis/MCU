**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent locates grass blocks
 - whether the agent successfully collects grass using the correct tool (e.g., shears)
 - whether the agent collects the required amount of grass

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. breaking blocks unnecessarily, wandering aimlessly without collecting grass

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when it is using the wrong tool and switches to the correct one
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using unique patterns or methods to efficiently collect grass
 - e.g. demonstrating an innovative approach to navigate the terrain while collecting

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools to maximize grass collection efficiency (e.g., using shears instead of breaking grass blocks)

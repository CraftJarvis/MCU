**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent equips the shield
 - whether the agent encounters zombies
 - whether the agent successfully blocks zombie attacks using the shield

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. unnecessary movements away from zombies, switching to unrelated items, or attacking zombies without using the shield

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes when the shield is not equipped and corrects it promptly
 - whether the agent adjusts its position or strategy when the shield is not effectively blocking attacks

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using the environment to its advantage while blocking, such as positioning against a wall to minimize attack angles
 - e.g. combining shield use with other defensive maneuvers like dodging or using terrain for cover

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary movements and maximize defense against zombie attacks

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent equips and uses the shield correctly and consistently
 - whether the agent avoids using unrelated items that do not contribute to warding off zombies with the shield

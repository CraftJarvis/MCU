**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**  
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if the snow blocks or carved pumpkin are incorrectly placed  
 - whether the agent corrects any mistakes to successfully create the snow golem  

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**  
 - e.g. arranging additional snow blocks around the snow golem for decoration  
 - e.g. using different materials to create a themed area for the snow golems  

**Task Completion Efficiency**  
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range  
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary actions, such as not repeatedly placing or breaking blocks  

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**  
 - e.g. whether the agent uses the correct type of snow blocks and a carved pumpkin for the task  
 - whether the agent avoids using incorrect materials that do not contribute to building the snow golem

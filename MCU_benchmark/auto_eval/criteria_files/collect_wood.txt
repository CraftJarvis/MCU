**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent locates a tree
 - whether the agent interacts with the tree
 - whether the agent successfully collects wood blocks

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly, attacking non-related entities, or collecting unrelated items.
 
**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent identifies the wrong type of block and adjusts to target wood blocks instead.
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different methods or tools to collect wood, such as axes for efficiency.
 - e.g. utilizing strategic paths or techniques to access hard-to-reach wood blocks.

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools, if available, for efficient wood collection.

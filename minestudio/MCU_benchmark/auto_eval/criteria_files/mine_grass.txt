**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent interacts with the grass block
 - whether the agent successfully mines the grass block
 - whether the agent collects the dropped items, if any

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. clicking on other unrelated items, digging blocks other than the grass block

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if it is mining the wrong block and corrects its action to mine the grass block
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different tools or methods to mine the grass block, such as using a shovel instead of bare hands

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools, such as a shovel, to mine the grass block
 - whether the agent makes efficient use of the available tools and materials during the task

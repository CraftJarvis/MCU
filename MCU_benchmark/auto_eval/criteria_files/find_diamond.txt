**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent is mining in the correct layer (e.g., below Y=16)
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools for mining
 - whether the agent successfully finds and mines diamond ore

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. mining unnecessary blocks, wandering in irrelevant areas, or engaging with unrelated mobs

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent can recognize when it is in the wrong layer or using incorrect tools
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. employing unique mining patterns or strategies, using TNT for faster mining, using lighting to enhance visibility

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses the correct tools, such as an iron pickaxe or better, to mine diamond ore

- For decoration task, you can generate poppy, flower pot, torch, blue bed, red_dye and other similar things.
- Do not give me the final target things directly in my inventory.
- Some crafting tasks are not completed using the crafting table, they could be done with tools like the furnace, enchanting table, or brewing stand and so on. You need to select the appropriate tool.
- Remember to provide a crafting table, furnace, enchanting table, brewing stand or similar items, if the task requires it.
- When use /fill command, ensure not to generate them in inaccessible locations (such as high in the sky), and be extremely cautious not to suffocate the agent.
- The distance for summoning items should be within 4 blocks.
- For the "find" task, it is better to use /summonï¼Œ /fill, or /execute
- Attention, there are certain items that cannot be directly summoned, such as trees, sugar cane, bubble_coral, etc. You should use /execute  or /give

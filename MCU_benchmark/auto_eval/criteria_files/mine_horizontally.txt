**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent starts mining in a horizontal direction
 - whether the agent maintains a consistent horizontal mining path
 - whether the agent mines a sufficient distance horizontally, as specified by the task parameters

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. unnecessary vertical mining or digging upwards or downwards
 - e.g. breaking unrelated blocks that do not contribute to the horizontal mining path 

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if the mining path deviates from the intended horizontal direction and corrects it
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. employing different mining patterns or tools to optimize the mining process
 - e.g. creating a visually appealing tunnel design while mining

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate tools for mining to enhance efficiency
 - whether the agent avoids the use of materials that are not relevant to the task of horizontal mining

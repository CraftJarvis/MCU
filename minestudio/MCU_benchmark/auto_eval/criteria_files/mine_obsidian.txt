**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent locates a source of obsidian
 - whether the agent uses the correct tool (diamond pickaxe or netherite pickaxe) to mine obsidian
 - whether the agent successfully mines obsidian blocks

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. using incorrect tools to mine obsidian
 - e.g. mining other unrelated blocks or wandering aimlessly

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent switches to the correct tool upon realizing an error
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. creating an efficient mining strategy to collect obsidian faster
 - e.g. using water buckets to control lava flow and prevent loss of mined obsidian

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent correctly uses a diamond pickaxe or netherite pickaxe to mine obsidian
 - whether the agent efficiently manages inventory space for mined obsidian blocks

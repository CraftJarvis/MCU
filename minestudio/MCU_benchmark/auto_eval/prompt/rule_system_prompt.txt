You are an expert of Minecraft and good at training agents in AI field.
I will give you a task description in minecraft, you need to generate the score point for assessing the completion of the task.

You need to output five grading criteria, including Task Progress, material selection and usage, action control, error recognition and correction, creative attempts, and task completion efficiency. 
You should formulate specific rules under each criterion for different tasks and don't modify the content between the two asterisks (** **)


Building task should be focus on whether the agent has completed the basic shape and structure.
For example, the task name is build a house, please generate the score point of it. You should respond in the format as described as below:
**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent build four walls
 - whether the agent build a roof
 - whether the agent build a door 

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
    

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize the misaligned walls or incorrect material usage
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. uniquely shaped rooms, distinctive decorative elements like furniture

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**



For example, the task name is decorate the tree, please generate the score point of it. You should respond in the format as described as below:
**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - Is there a tree in the image
 - whether the agent put something on the tree

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. a purposeless arrangement of blocks, destory the tree, repeatedly clicking on items in the inventory without using them.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. Evaluate the overall visual effect of the decoration, including color coordination, layout rationality, and symmetry.
 - e.g. Is the decorations on the tree diverse and abundant?

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**





For example, the task name is eat carrots, please generate the score point of it. You should respond in the format as described as below:
**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent interact with the carrot
 - whether the agent hold the carrot in hand
 - whether the agent eat a carrot

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. click on other unrelated item, dig a hole.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize wrong item and put them back
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. different ways to eat carrots
 - e.g. eat more than one carrot 

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**



For example, the task name is dig three holes and fill one, please generate the score point of it. You should respond in the format as described as below:
**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agents is digging the hole
 - whether the agent dig three holes
 - whether the agent fill one hole

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly, destory the tree.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. use different tools to dig the holes like hands or pickaxes

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**



For example, the task name is trap a enderman with a boat, please generate the score point of it. You should respond in the format as described as below:
**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent interacts with the boat
 - whether the agent place the boat near the enderman
 - whether the agent try to attract the enderman
 - whether the enderman trapped in the boat 

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. incorrect operation causes agent itself to be attacked by enferman

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent is aware of the inability of the boat's placement to block the Enderman and proceeds to reposition it.
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. try different ways to attract enderman, use weaponds to protect itself. 

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**


Note:
 - For crafting tasks, it is important to distinguish whether the recipe book is opened and to identify the final item that needs to be crafted.
 - For motion tasks, such as using an item or eating an item, attention should be paid to the interaction with the item.

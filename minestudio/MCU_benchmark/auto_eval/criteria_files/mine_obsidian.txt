**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent locates a source of obsidian
 - whether the agent uses the correct tool (diamond or netherite pickaxe) to mine the obsidian
 - whether the agent successfully mines at least one block of obsidian

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. mining blocks that are not obsidian unnecessarily, wandering aimlessly without focus on the obsidian source

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes if an incorrect tool is being used and switches to the appropriate one
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using water to prevent lava from flowing onto mined obsidian
 - e.g. creating a safe area around the obsidian to mine efficiently

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors, such as mining with the correct angle to avoid lava

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses a diamond or netherite pickaxe to successfully mine obsidian

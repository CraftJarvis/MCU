**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent places blocks vertically to form a pillar
 - whether the pillar reaches a certain specified height
 - whether the pillar remains structurally stable and is not toppled or incomplete

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**

 - e.g. destroying already placed blocks without a valid reason

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent corrects misaligned or incorrectly placed blocks
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. adding decorative elements or patterns to the pillar
 - e.g. using different types of blocks to create a visually appealing pillar

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate materials for building the pillar
 - whether the materials used contribute to the structural integrity and aesthetics of the pillar

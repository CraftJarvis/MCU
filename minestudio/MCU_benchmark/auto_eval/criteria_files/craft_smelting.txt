**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent places a furnace
 - whether the agent places food inside the furnace
 - whether the agent provides fuel for the furnace
 - whether the agent successfully smelts the food

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. destroying the furnace after placing it, repeatedly opening and closing the furnace interface without adding items

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes incorrect fuel or food placement and corrects it
 - whether the agent identifies and resolves issues like running out of fuel during the smelting process

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different types of fuel for smelting
 - e.g. smelting multiple types of food items in sequence

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors, such as efficiently placing items and managing fuel

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent correctly uses the furnace, appropriate fuel, and food items
 - whether the agent avoids wasting resources by using appropriate amounts of fuel and food

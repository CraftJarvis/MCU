**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent places lava
 - whether the agent places water such that it interacts with the lava
 - whether the interaction results in the creation of obsidian

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. placing water or lava in locations that do not lead to interaction
 - e.g. destroying already placed water or lava sources unnecessarily

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes incorrect placement of water or lava and adjusts accordingly
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different methods to place water and lava, such as buckets or other containers
 - e.g. creating a controlled environment to ensure efficient obsidian production

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent correctly uses water and lava to produce obsidian
 - whether the agent conserves and makes efficient use of the water and lava sources

Note:  
- You should provide accurate information and executable cheat commands of Minecraft.  
- The quantity of items in the cheat command should be more than what is required. For example, if the task needs at least 10 emeralds, provide 20 instead.  
- You should provide all the tools and environments required for completing the task.  
- Attention, there are certain items that cannot be directly summoned, such as trees, sugar cane, bubble_coral, etc. You should use /execute or /give.  
- For decoration tasks, you can generate poppies, flower pots, torches, blue beds, red_dye, and other similar things.  
- Do not give me the final target things directly in my inventory.  
- Some crafting tasks are not completed using the crafting table. They could be done with tools like the furnace, enchanting table, brewing stand, or similar tools. You need to select the appropriate tool.  
- Remember to provide a crafting table, furnace, enchanting table, brewing stand, or similar items if the task requires it. Use /give.  
- When using /fill command, ensure not to generate them in inaccessible locations (such as high in the sky), and be extremely cautious not to suffocate the agent.  
- The distance for summoning items should be within 4 blocks.

**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task**
 - whether the agent finds and approaches a bed
 - whether the agent interacts with the bed
 - whether the agent successfully enters the sleep state

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. interacting with unrelated items, destroying the bed, wandering aimlessly instead of heading towards the bed

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize incorrect interactions (e.g., trying to sleep during the day) and adjust their actions accordingly
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. placing the bed in a unique or safe location before sleeping
 - e.g. using surrounding environment or items to ensure safety while sleeping (e.g., building a small shelter around the bed)

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. using a bed from inventory or crafting one if necessary before attempting to sleep

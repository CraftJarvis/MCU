text: combat and kill Endermen
thinking: '- In order to combat an Enderman, we need weapons, armor, and Endermen
  nearby. The Diamond Armor Set is recommended for high protection, and a Diamond
  Sword is effective for attacking. Be aware that Endermen teleport, so having Ender
  Pearls for quick escapes is useful. Endermen are more aggressive at night, so setting
  the time to night and giving night vision can be helpful. Additionally, rain can
  deter Endermen as they dislike water.'

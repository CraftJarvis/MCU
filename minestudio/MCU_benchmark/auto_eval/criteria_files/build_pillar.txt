**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent selects the appropriate location for the pillar
 - whether the agent successfully builds a vertical structure

 - e.g. incorporating additional structural elements like support beams or decorative elements

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses suitable materials for building a stable pillar

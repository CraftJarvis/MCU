**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent equips the trident
 - whether the agent aims correctly
 - whether the agent uses the trident to attack a target

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions** 
 - e.g. switching to unrelated items in the inventory, unnecessary movements that do not contribute to aiming or attacking.

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes** 
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes a missed throw and adjusts the aim or positioning accordingly.
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task** 
 - e.g. using the tridentâ€™s enchantments creatively, such as using Riptide to travel.
 - e.g. attacking multiple targets in one throw or using the trident in combination with other tools or strategies.

**Task Completion Efficiency** 
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors, such as retrieving the trident efficiently.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials** 
 - ensure the trident is used appropriately, considering durability and enchantments.

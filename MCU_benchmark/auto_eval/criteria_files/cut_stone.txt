**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
- whether the agent locates and selects the stone block
- whether the agent uses the correct tool to cut the stone
- whether the agent successfully cuts the stone into the desired size or shape

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
- e.g. using incorrect tools that do not affect stone, wandering aimlessly without interacting with stone

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
- e.g. whether the agent detects using an incorrect tool and switches to a suitable one
- whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
- e.g. experimenting with cutting different shapes out of the stone
- e.g. utilizing different methods or strategies to enhance the cutting process

**Task Completion Efficiency**
- whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
- whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors in cutting

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
- whether the agent selects the appropriate tool for cutting stone
- whether the agent conserves materials by minimizing waste during cutting

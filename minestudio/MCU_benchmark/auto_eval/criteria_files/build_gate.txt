**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent builds two supporting pillars
 - whether the agent constructs an arch connecting the two pillars
 - whether the gate is symmetrically aligned

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. destroying already built sections of the gate
 - e.g. placing blocks far away from the intended structure

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes any misalignment or incorrect placements of the arch
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. adding decorative elements to the gate like banners or lanterns
 - e.g. using different materials to create a visually appealing design

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - whether the agent uses appropriate materials for the pillars and arch
 - whether the materials chosen contribute to the stability and aesthetics of the gate

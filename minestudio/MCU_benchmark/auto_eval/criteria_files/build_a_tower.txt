**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent builds a stable and vertical structure
 - whether the agent builds a platform or base for the tower
 - whether the agent achieves a certain height for the tower

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. placing and breaking blocks repeatedly without progress
 - wandering away from the construction site

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether the agent recognizes misaligned blocks and corrects them
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. design elements such as decorative patterns or unique architectural features
 - e.g. incorporation of windows, balconies, or other functional elements

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective construction strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. whether the agent uses appropriate materials for structural integrity and aesthetics
 - whether the agent efficiently manages resources to avoid running out of materials during construction

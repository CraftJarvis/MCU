Note:
- You should provide accurate information and executable cheat commands for Minecraft.
- The quantity of items in the cheat command should be more than what is required. For example, if the task needs at least 10 emeralds, provide 20 instead.
- You should provide all the tools and environments required for completing the task.
- For decoration tasks, you can generate items like poppies, flower pots, torches, blue beds, red dye, and other similar things.
- Do not give me the final target items directly in my inventory.
- Some crafting tasks are not completed using the crafting table. They might require tools like a furnace, enchanting table, brewing stand, etc. You need to select the appropriate tool.
- Remember to provide a crafting table, furnace, enchanting table, brewing stand, or similar items if the task requires it.
- When using the /fill command, ensure that the items are not generated in inaccessible locations (such as high in the sky), and be extremely cautious not to suffocate the agent.
- The distance for summoning items should be within 4 blocks.
- For "find" tasks, it is better to use /summon, /fill, or /execute.
- Be aware that there are certain items that cannot be directly summoned, such as trees, sugar cane, bubble coral, etc. You should use /execute or /give instead.

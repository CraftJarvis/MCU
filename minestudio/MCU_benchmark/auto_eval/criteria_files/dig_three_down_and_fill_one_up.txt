**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent initiates the digging process
 - whether the agent digs three blocks down vertically

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. moving away from the digging site unnecessarily, breaking unrelated blocks

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - whether the agent identifies incorrect depth or location and corrects it
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the final product.

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. using different materials to fill the hole back up, employing different tools for digging

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range.
 - whether effective strategies were employed to minimize unnecessary repetitions or errors.

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
